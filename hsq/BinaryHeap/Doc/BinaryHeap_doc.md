### Binary Heap

Binary heap (aka priority queue) which can be minumum/maximum depending on
the user needs. The heap is generic, in the sense that any type of data can
be stored in it. It also allows for the user to use dynamically or statically 
allocated memory.

The module does NOT deal with memory allocation/deallocation. It is the 
user's responsibility to assure that memory management is done in the 
correct way.
